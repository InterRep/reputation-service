#### SUMMARY #####
# Start a seed list of users we accept as real without a bot check
# Decide to trust who seed users follow - add them to db
# Decide to trust members of lists created by trusted curators
# Note: We don't strictly care that this account is a real person in a KYC sense -
# they simply must a reputable, non-bot identity. So pseudonymous influencers count as "real"
